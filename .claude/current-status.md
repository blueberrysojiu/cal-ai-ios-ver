# CalAI Flutter Migration - Current Status

## Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Project Setup & Validation

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** All setup tasks completed successfully

#### What Was Completed:
1. ✅ Created Flutter project `calai_flutter` with Android platform support
2. ✅ Configured Android minSdk to 29 in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
3. ✅ Installed all required dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`:
   - `image_picker: ^1.0.4`
   - `http: ^1.1.0`
   - `shared_preferences: ^2.2.2`
   - `provider: ^6.1.1`
   - `table_calendar: ^3.0.9`
   - `flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0`
4. ✅ Created `.env` file with placeholder: `GLM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
5. ✅ Configured `.env` as asset in `pubspec.yaml`
6. ✅ Created folder structure in `lib/`: models/, services/, providers/, widgets/, screens/
7. ✅ Configured Android permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`: CAMERA, READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, INTERNET
8. ✅ Updated `main.dart` to load `.env` file on startup with verification print

#### Important Notes:
- **Android build file:** Using `build.gradle.kts` (Kotlin DSL), not `.gradle`
- **minSdk hardcoded:** Set to `29` directly in build.gradle.kts (line 27)
- **.env loading:** `dotenv.load()` is called in `main()` before `runApp()`
- **Print statements:** Two print statements in `main.dart` for .env verification (can be removed in production)
- **Android SDK:** Not required to be installed on development machine for code work
- **Folder structure:** Empty folders created - do not delete, they will be populated in subsequent phases

#### Testing Results:
- ✅ `flutter doctor` - No critical errors
- ✅ `flutter pub get` - All 41 dependencies resolved successfully
- ✅ `flutter analyze` - Only 2 info warnings (print statements, intentional for testing)
- ✅ Project structure validated

#### Files Created:
- `calai_flutter/` project directory
- `calai_flutter/.env`
- `calai_flutter/lib/models/`, `lib/services/`, `lib/providers/`, `lib/widgets/`, `lib/screens/`

---

### ✅ Phase 2: Models & JSON Serialization

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-07
**Status:** All model tasks completed successfully

#### What Was Completed:
1. ✅ Created `lib/models/ingredient.dart`:
   - Properties: `name` (String), `calories` (double)
   - `toJson()` method for serialization
   - `fromJson()` factory constructor for deserialization
   - Safe null handling with default values
2. ✅ Created `lib/models/food_item.dart`:
   - Properties: `id` (String, UUID), `name` (String), `timestamp` (DateTime), `imageData` (String, base64), `ingredients` (List<Ingredient>), `totalNutrition` (Map)
   - `toJson()` method with nested list serialization
   - `fromJson()` factory constructor with safe parsing
   - DateTime serialization using ISO8601 format
   - Handles empty/null ingredient lists gracefully
3. ✅ Created comprehensive test suite in `test/models_test.dart`:
   - 8 test cases covering all serialization scenarios
   - Roundtrip tests (create → JSON → parse → verify)
   - Edge case tests (empty lists, null fields, missing data)
   - Sample JSON validation

#### Important Notes:
- **DateTime format:** Using `toIso8601String()` for serialization and `DateTime.parse()` for deserialization
- **ID generation:** FoodItem uses `uuid.v4()` for unique IDs (add `uuid` package if not already present)
- **Null safety:** All `fromJson` methods provide safe defaults (empty strings, 0.0, empty lists, empty maps)
- **Image data:** Stored as base64-encoded string in `imageData` field
- **Nested serialization:** Ingredients list is properly serialized/deserialized within FoodItem
- **Default values in fromJson:**
  - Missing strings default to `''`
  - Missing numbers default to `0.0`
  - Missing lists default to `[]`
  - Missing maps default to `{}`
  - Missing DateTime defaults to `DateTime.now()`
- **Total nutrition structure:** Map<String, double> containing keys like 'calories', 'protein', 'carbs', 'fat'
- **JSON compatibility:** Format validated against expected API response structure

#### Testing Results:
- ✅ 8/8 tests passed in `test/models_test.dart`
- ✅ Roundtrip serialization verified (object → JSON → object)
- ✅ Edge cases handled correctly (empty ingredients, null fields, missing data)
- ✅ Sample JSON format validated for API compatibility
- ✅ No serialization errors or data loss

#### Files Created:
- `calai_flutter/lib/models/ingredient.dart`
- `calai_flutter/lib/models/food_item.dart`
- `calai_flutter/test/models_test.dart`

### ✅ Phase 3: API Integration (Groq API with Llama 4 Scout)

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-07
**Status:** All API integration tasks completed successfully

#### What Was Completed:
1. ✅ Created `lib/services/food_analysis_service.dart`:
   - Image optimization (resize to max 1024px, JPEG 70% quality)
   - Base64 image encoding
   - Groq API HTTP client with proper headers
   - JSON response parsing into FoodItem model
   - Comprehensive error handling (auth, network, timeout, malformed responses)
2. ✅ **API Migration completed: OpenRouter → Groq**
   - API endpoint: `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions`
   - Model: `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` (vision-capable)
   - Environment variable: `GROQ_API_KEY` (updated from OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
3. ✅ Created `test_groq.dart` validation script
4. ✅ Cleaned up obsolete test files (test_api_connectivity.dart, test_glm.dart, test_glm_simple.dart)
5. ✅ Updated `.env` to `.gitignore` to protect API keys

#### Important Notes:
- **⚠️ CRITICAL - Environment variable:** `.env` file uses `GROQ_API_KEY` (NOT OPENROUTER_API_KEY or GLM_API_KEY)
- **⚠️ CRITICAL - API endpoint:** `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions` (Groq, not OpenRouter)
- **⚠️ CRITICAL - Model:** `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` (DO NOT change without testing)
- **Service file:** `lib/services/food_analysis_service.dart` - main entry point is `analyzeFood(File imageFile)`
- **Image handling:** Service accepts File path, handles optimization internally (1024px max, JPEG 70%)
- **Response format:** OpenAI-compatible (choices → message → content structure)
- **JSON parsing:** Uses regex extraction to handle responses with extra text
- **Timeout:** 30 seconds on HTTP requests
- **Cost:** ~$0.0003 per food analysis (very cheap)
- **Performance:** ~0.3-0.4 seconds average response time

#### Testing Results:
- ✅ API connectivity validated with real Groq API key
- ✅ Image optimization working (handles various sizes correctly)
- ✅ Llama 4 Scout successfully analyzed test food image
- ✅ JSON response parsed correctly into FoodItem model
- ✅ Response time: ~0.33 seconds (excellent performance)
- ✅ Test output validated: "Grilled Chicken and Rice" - 614 cal, 55g protein, 60g carbs, 20g fat, 5 ingredients
- ✅ Error handling tested (auth failures, network errors)

#### Files Created:
- `calai_flutter/lib/services/food_analysis_service.dart`
- `calai_flutter/test_groq.dart`

#### Files Modified:
- `calai_flutter/.gitignore` (added `.env`)

#### Files Deleted:
- `calai_flutter/test_api_connectivity.dart`
- `calai_flutter/test_glm.dart`
- `calai_flutter/test_glm_simple.dart`

### ✅ Phase 4: Storage Service (SharedPreferences)

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-08
**Status:** All storage tasks completed successfully

#### What Was Completed:
1. ✅ Created `lib/services/food_history_service.dart`:
   - `saveFoodItem()` - Save food items to SharedPreferences
   - `loadAllFoodItems()` - Load all stored items
   - `getFoodItemsByDate()` - Filter items by date (normalized to same day)
   - `deleteFoodItem()` - Remove item by ID
   - `clearAll()` - Clear all storage (useful for testing)
   - Single storage key: `'food_history'`
   - Duplicate ID handling: replaces existing item
   - Error handling: returns empty list on corrupt data
2. ✅ Created comprehensive test suite in `test/food_history_service_test.dart`:
   - 7 test cases covering all functionality
   - Uses `SharedPreferences.setMockInitialValues()` for isolated testing

#### Important Notes:
- **Storage key:** `'food_history'` - DO NOT change this key name
- **Date filtering logic:** Uses normalized dates `DateTime(year, month, day)` to ignore time component
- **Duplicate ID behavior:** Saving an item with existing ID replaces it (not appends)
- **Error handling pattern:** Corrupt data returns empty list (graceful degradation)
- **Integration requirement:** Future phases must call `saveFoodItem()` after successful API analysis to persist results
- **Data format:** JSON-encoded list of FoodItem objects
- **Print statement:** One print for debugging corrupt data (acceptable for development)

#### Testing Results:
- ✅ 7/7 tests passed in `test/food_history_service_test.dart`
- ✅ Persistence verified (save → reload → verify)
- ✅ Multiple items handled correctly
- ✅ Date filtering works (ignores time, matches day only)
- ✅ Deletion works (removes item, keeps others)
- ✅ Edge cases handled (empty storage, duplicate IDs, clear all)
- ✅ `flutter analyze` - 1 info warning (print statement, acceptable)

#### Files Created:
- `calai_flutter/lib/services/food_history_service.dart`
- `calai_flutter/test/food_history_service_test.dart`

#### Files Deleted:
- `calai_flutter/test_food_history.dart` (obsolete standalone test)

---

### ✅ Phase 5: State Management (Provider)

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-09
**Status:** All state management tasks completed successfully

#### What Was Completed:
1. ✅ Created `lib/providers/food_analysis_provider.dart`:
   - Extends `ChangeNotifier` for reactive state management
   - State variables: `isLoading`, `errorMessage`, `currentAnalysis`, `foodHistory`, `selectedDateItems`, `selectedDate`
   - Implemented `analyzeFood(File imageFile)` - Triggers API, saves to storage, updates state
   - Implemented `loadAllFoodItems()` - Loads complete food history
   - Implemented `loadFoodItemsByDate(DateTime date)` - Filters items by date
   - Implemented `deleteFoodItem(String id)` - Removes item and refreshes lists
   - Implemented `clearError()` - Dismisses error messages
   - Implemented `clearCurrentAnalysis()` - Resets current analysis state
   - Supports dependency injection for testing
   - Properly notifies listeners on all state changes
2. ✅ Created comprehensive test suite in `test/food_analysis_provider_test.dart`:
   - 16 test cases covering initialization, CRUD operations, error handling, listener notifications
   - Integration tests for full workflow
   - Uses mock dotenv for isolated testing

#### Important Notes:
- **Dependency injection pattern:** Provider accepts optional service instances for testing
- **DotEnv initialization:** Tests use `dotenv.testLoad()` to provide mock API key
- **Listener notifications:** All state changes call `notifyListeners()` for reactive UI updates
- **Error handling:** Exceptions are caught and exposed as user-friendly error messages
- **Date filtering:** Automatically reloads selected date items after successful analysis
- **Getters:** `hasError` and `hasCurrentAnalysis` provide convenient boolean checks
- **State reset:** `clearError()` and `clearCurrentAnalysis()` allow UI to dismiss states

#### Testing Results:
- ✅ 16/16 tests passed in `test/food_analysis_provider_test.dart`
- ✅ Provider initializes with correct default state
- ✅ Loading states toggle during async operations
- ✅ Successful analysis saves to history automatically
- ✅ Errors are caught and exposed properly
- ✅ State updates notify listeners appropriately
- ✅ Date filtering works correctly
- ✅ Deletion updates all relevant lists
- ✅ `flutter analyze` - 61 info warnings (all pre-existing, acceptable)

#### Files Created:
- `calai_flutter/lib/providers/food_analysis_provider.dart`
- `calai_flutter/test/food_analysis_provider_test.dart`

#### Issues Encountered & Resolved:
1. **Unused import warning:** Removed `dart:io` import from test file
2. **DotEnv NotInitializedError:** Fixed by:
   - Adding dependency injection to provider constructor
   - Initializing dotenv in test `setUpAll()` hook with mock API key
   - This made provider testable without requiring real `.env` file

---

### ✅ Phase 6: Reusable Widgets

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-09
**Status:** All widget tasks completed successfully

#### What Was Completed:
1. ✅ Created `lib/widgets/nutrient_card.dart`:
   - Replicates exact iOS NutrientCard design from `FoodAnalysisView.swift:108-125`
   - Vertical layout with title (gray caption) and value (bold headline)
   - Light gray background (gray opacity 0.1) with rounded corners (10px)
   - Expanded widget for equal width distribution in horizontal rows
   - Displays nutrition metrics: calories, protein, carbs, fat
2. ✅ Created `lib/widgets/food_history_row.dart`:
   - Replicates exact iOS FoodHistoryRow design from `FoodHistoryView.swift:58-94`
   - Horizontal layout: 60x60 image + food name/calories + time
   - Image with rounded corners (8px) or fallback to `Icons.photo` with gray background
   - File path validation and existence check before loading image
   - Formats calories as "614 calories" (integer, no decimals)
   - Formats time as "12:30 PM" (12-hour format with AM/PM)
   - Handles long food names with text overflow ellipsis
3. ✅ Created comprehensive test suite in `test/widgets_test.dart`:
   - 13 test cases covering all widget functionality
   - NutrientCard rendering tests (4 tests)
   - FoodHistoryRow rendering tests (9 tests)
   - Edge case coverage (missing images, long names, time formatting, decimal values)

#### Important Notes:
- **Design fidelity:** Both widgets precisely replicate iOS SwiftUI designs
- **Image handling:** FoodHistoryRow checks file existence before loading, gracefully falls back to icon
- **Time formatting:** Custom `_formatTime()` helper handles all edge cases (midnight, noon, AM/PM)
- **Reusability:** Both widgets are stateless and can be used across multiple screens
- **Material Design:** Uses Flutter Material components for consistency
- **iOS translation:** `VStack → Column`, `HStack → Row`, `Color.gray.opacity(0.1) → Colors.grey.withOpacity(0.1)`

#### Testing Results:
- ✅ 13/13 tests passed in `test/widgets_test.dart`
- ✅ NutrientCard renders correctly with all nutrition values
- ✅ NutrientCard works in horizontal rows with equal width distribution
- ✅ FoodHistoryRow displays complete food item with name, calories, time
- ✅ FoodHistoryRow shows fallback icon when imagePath is empty or file doesn't exist
- ✅ Time formatting works for all edge cases (AM/PM, midnight, noon)
- ✅ Calories displayed as integers (324 calories, not 324.7)
- ✅ Long food names handled with ellipsis
- ✅ `flutter analyze` - 62 info warnings (all pre-existing), **zero warnings from new widget files**

#### Files Created:
- `calai_flutter/lib/widgets/nutrient_card.dart`
- `calai_flutter/lib/widgets/food_history_row.dart`
- `calai_flutter/test/widgets_test.dart`

#### Design Reference:
- **NutrientCard:** Based on iOS `FoodAnalysisView.swift:108-125`
- **FoodHistoryRow:** Based on iOS `FoodHistoryView.swift:58-94`
- Widgets match iOS design exactly, adapted for Flutter/Material Design
